   "Description": "Alternative Contact Details:[Skype]PAX Frederick Development Environment - PASX 3.1.7.Scenario: BF1 with a verification step exists within a loop. Initially BF1 is processed normally. and the verification is signed. Before the 1st repetition of the loop is completed. a correction is performed on BF1. The verification is not re-signed at the time (PASX does not enforce that is should be re-signed at the time). When the loop is completed - if it goes to a second repetition - then repetition 2 of BF1 will not be created. even though repetition 2 will be created for the rest of the loop. This means that the second loop cannot be processed past this point - and the EBR effectively becomes locked. or in-executable.This bug was discovered during testing of a GMBR in the Frederick development environment. An example of the scenario can be seen in PMBR ID ER190418 version 1.To reproduce the issue execute as follows:Execute 500BRX>CBF5>CBF2 and sign the verification.Before executing 500BRX>CBF5>CBF14. correct the actual value of one of the activities in 500BRX>CBF5>CBF2. but do not sign the verification.Now execute 500BRX>CBF5>CBF14.Choose Repeat Sample at 500BRX>CBF5>Dec2.It will not be possible to do anything in the second repetition of the loop. except to sign the verification signature on 500BRX>CBF5>CBF2.After that the EBR will effectively locked.Investigation should ideally : a. Report issue to Werum to establish if a known issue. and whether fixed in later versionsb. Determine if there are any workarounds or interventions that can be performed if this occurs in production. So far it has only happened in the development environment. but there is a medium likelihood of it happening at some point in a Production batch - and the EBR becoming in-executable would have a critical impact in this case.See MO VT003964 in PASX Frederick Dev  V3.1.7 to see an executed SFO containing the issue.",

This way. the user can just select the compound that you have at the top and it only shows the text you need for those. Avoiding spending time in merging different templates. Is there any way that you can filter the coloured text (keeping the black template)? Or the only way will be to create separate templates?

After upgrading it was about the same. but it wasn't so bad as to affect my work. Recently the computer has been slowing down even more. and it is now starting to have a significant effect on my productivity. MedChem ELN (which has separate problems with speed affecting all users) is virtually unusable. and I am very far behind in closing experiments due to how long it is taking. All other activities on the computer. such as opening programs for the first time. starting up in the morning etc. are now very slow. and quite often crash. Whilst typing this message there is severe lag between when I type and when it appears onscreen. Is there anything you can do about this? Many thanks",
